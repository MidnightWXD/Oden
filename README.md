# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Description

This app helps user to take a look at the information for the company departmetn and employees.
User can easily update any information for employees and department.

For example, View All Employees by manager option will show a table contains two column, one is employee name another is manager name which shows left employee's manager name.

You can change any employee's manager by using Update Employee Manager option.

npm mysql2 is used to connect to the mysql database.
npm figlet is used to show ASCII art at the beginning of the app.
npm iquirer is used to prompt question and get user input.

I made all options which are related to tables dynamically by using async and await key words.
